The task is to use the ANSI C language to write a simple shell program - Micro shell. 
This program should accept commands at the input and then perform actions according to their content. The shell should:

Display a prompt in the form [{path}] $, where {path} is the path to the current working directory,

Handle the cd command, working analogically to the one known from the bash shell,

Handle the exit command, terminating the shell program,

Gandle the help command, displaying on the screen information about the author of the program and the features it offers,

Support two other, arbitrarily selected shell commands (this is for example about your own, simple, simple implementation of two commands)

To take commands that refer to the scripts and programs found in the directories described by the value of the PATH environment variable 
and allow these scripts and programs to be called with arguments.

Print an error message when the command can not be interpreted correctly.

In addition, 2 points are awarded for additional gadgets (depending on the complexity of the problem)
E.g
displaying the login of currently logged in user, 
handling colors, 
handling arguments in quotes,
sensible handling of signals (eg Ctrl + Z), 
handling command history, etc.


The code should be put in one file named microshell.c
